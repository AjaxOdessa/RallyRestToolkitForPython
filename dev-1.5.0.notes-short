/Users/lehki03/projects/RallyRestToolkitForPython has the current dev state as branch labeled 'hacktonia' .
     the above has .git/config whose remote "origin" goes to RallySoftware/RallyTools/RallyRestToolkitForPython
     which is the repo where things get officially released as long as I have a klehman-rally Github account.

/Users/lehki03/dev/github/pyral is where dev should be done, but that didn't happen in 1.5.0 dev cycle.
      the above has .git/config whose remote "origin" goes to klehman-rally/pyral repo (I call this mine...)
      usually what happens is that I do my own PR in this repo, then I PR in the RallySoftware Github org
      to get into master the elements that are ready for release.

have to set these things in your environment
   to be able to run tests

    working directory /Users/lehki03/projects/RallyRestToolkitForPython

   use pyenv, get 3.6.11 installed and use that as your baseline (follow on with 3.7 and/or 3.8 later)

   # set up for use of pyenv
   eval "$(pyenv init -)"

   pyenv shell 3.6.11


   set these env vars:
      PYTHON=python3.6
      export PYTHONPATH=".:/Users/lehki03/python:/Users/lehki03/projects/RallyRestToolkitForPython"
      PYTEST=/Users/lehki03/.pyenv/versions/3.6.11/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pytest.py
